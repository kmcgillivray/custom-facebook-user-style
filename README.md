Custom Facebook User Style
==========================

A custom CSS file for adjusting the styles of facebook.com.

It removes the left sidebar navigation that I don't use, removes the default blue color scheme, and fades the right sidebar out slightly.

It does *not* remove ads.

## Installation

Go ahead and look up on Google instructions for setting up custom user styles in your browser. I use Stylish in Chrome.
